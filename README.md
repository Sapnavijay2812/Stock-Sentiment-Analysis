# Stock Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning Techniques (#FC24OPS3)

## Overview

The **Stock Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning Techniques** project aims to develop a robust sentiment analysis model that predicts the movement of stock prices based on textual data from news articles, social media posts, and other financial news and opinion sources. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in these texts, the model will seek to uncover insights into investor sentiment and market sentiment, providing valuable indicators for making informed trading decisions.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection:**
    - Gather a large dataset of textual data related to stocks.
    - Sources include news articles, social media posts, earnings reports, and analyst reports.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Remove noise from the textual data.
    - Tokenize text into words or phrases.
    - Apply techniques such as stemming and lemmatization to standardize text representations.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StockSentimentAnalysis.git
cd StockSentimentAnalysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Collection:**
    - Execute the `data_collection.py` script to collect data from various sources.
    - Ensure you have the necessary API keys and access credentials for the data sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Run the `preprocessing.py` script to clean and preprocess the collected textual data.
    - The script will remove noise, tokenize text, and standardize text representations.

3. **Model Training:**
    - Use the `train_model.py` script to train the sentiment analysis model on the preprocessed data.
    - Configure the model parameters and training settings as needed.

4. **Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate the model's performance using the `evaluate_model.py` script.
    - The script will generate performance metrics and visualizations to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

## Data Collection

The data collection process involves gathering textual data related to stocks from various sources. This includes:

- **News Articles:** Scrape or use APIs to collect news articles related to specific stocks or the stock market in general.
- **Social Media Posts:** Collect posts from platforms like Twitter and Reddit that discuss stock market opinions and sentiments.
- **Earnings Reports:** Gather earnings reports from company websites and financial databases.
- **Analyst Reports:** Collect reports from financial analysts that provide insights and predictions about stock performance.

## Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing the collected textual data is crucial for improving the accuracy of the sentiment analysis model. The preprocessing steps include:

- **Noise Removal:** Eliminate irrelevant information such as HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords.
- **Tokenization:** Split text into individual words or phrases (tokens).
- **Stemming and Lemmatization:** Reduce words to their base or root form to standardize text representations.

## Model Training

Train the sentiment analysis model using machine learning techniques. The steps involved are:

1. **Feature Extraction:** Convert the preprocessed text into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
2. **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable machine learning model, such as logistic regression, SVM, or a neural network.
3. **Training:** Train the model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the model parameters to achieve the best performance.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model using various metrics to assess its performance. Key evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** Metrics to evaluate the model's performance on positive and negative classes.
- **Confusion Matrix:** A table to visualize the performance of the classification model.
